# NoCodeSeg: Deep segmentation made easy!

This is the official repository for the manuscript *"Code-free development and deployment of deep segmentation models for digital pathology"*, submitted to Frontiers in Medicine. 

The repository contains trained deep models for epithelium segmentation of HE and CD3 immunostained WSIs, as well as source code relevant for importing/exporting annotations/predictions in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/), from [DeepMIB](http://mib.helsinki.fi/downloads.html), and [FastPathology](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology).

A video tutorial of the proposed pipeline can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dTfUwnL6zY&ab_channel=HenrikSahlinPettersen):

## Data
The 251 annotated WSIs are being processed before publishing on [dataverseNO](https://dataverse.no/), where it can be downloaded and used for free by anyone.
